\chapter{Features Engineering}
\label{capitolo4}
\thispagestyle{empty}

In this chapter we want to analyze the set of available features and expand it with new ones, based on the properties of tweets and pictures. 

\section{Baseline}
Some features are ready to be used in a classifier, while other ones need to be pre-processed to allow them to be more expressive. In this section we analyze the complete set of default profile features and which kind of pre-processing operation we applied. With this default set we trained a classifier to define a baseline and this allowed us to evaluate the improvements made by the features engineering step.

Features processed as "delete - relative feature" are those ones related to the user who performed the scraping. So we didn't need them.
