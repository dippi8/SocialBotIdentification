\chapter{Model selection}
\label{capitolo5}
\thispagestyle{empty}

In this chapter we will show the choices and stages behind the final model.
Starting from baseline models, we enhanced the chosen model with handcrafted features from the last chapter.\\
We saw and studied the performance improvements with validation approaches, and this phase led us to our current solution.\\
The result is a stacking ensemble, involving three models: two Random Forests, working on different purposes, and a Naive Bayes classifier.\\
The first Random Forest classifier has been used to provide an early filter on the separation between Genuine accounts and Bots.\\
The second Random Forest gives a classification among the five studied categories.\\
The last model, a Naive Bayes classifier, has been used over the same classes of the second Random Forest, but it reads and labels the users, according on their tweets only.
