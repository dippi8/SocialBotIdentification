\chapter{Model selection}

\thispagestyle{empty}

In this chapter we will show the choices and stages behind the final model.
Starting from baseline models, we enhanced the chosen classifiers with handcrafted features coming from the last chapter.\\
We saw and studied the performance improvements with validation approaches, and this phase led us to our current solution.

The result involves three models:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[\PencilRight] a first Random Forest classifier that has been used to provide an early filter on the separation between Genuine accounts and Bots
	\item[\PencilRight] a second Random Forest that gives a classification among the five studied categories
	\item[\PencilRight] a Naive Bayes classifier, used over the same classes of the second Random Forest, but it reads and labels the users, according on their tweets only
\end{itemize}
All the above mentioned algorithms were combined with a stacking ensemble methods, after considering different possibilities.

\section{Baselines}
The choices explained in this section were made at the same time of the ones listed in the Baseline section of the last chapter.

This is, basically, the same stage of the above-mentioned, but in a model-driven perspective.
The features involved are the ones described in that chapter, but we started from that base, to try different classifiers over it.
Each classifier has been fitted with the entire dataset, but considering only baselines features.

Furthermore, no parameters tuning has been applied, in order to minimize the results of our baselines classifier, with their standard assets.
\subsection{Random Forest}
The Random Forest was tested with the Scikit-Learn library, wit the following method and asset:\\
\textit{RandomForestClassifier(n\_estimators = 10, criterion = 'entropy', random\_state = 42)}\\
At first, it was tested with a holdout approach, with 75\% of the sample in the training set, and the 25\% in the test set.\\
The resulting confusion matrix is the following:\\

\subsection{KNN}
